I conceive of this having folders for different endpoints that are going to want to send back an HTML object
along with the rest of the json.  React envisions all all html/css/js to be front loaded so all that's needed 
are the individual data pieces from a json response.  However, in the real world, that only works for the main 
portions of the page.  It is much more efficient and dynamic in every respect if certain sections are still 
load-on-demand.  Especially with the move toward using Android and IOS devices. 

Note:  The css files should _only_ be overrides or additions to the base css file front-loaded by React in most 
cases.  And any JS should _never_ override.  The class/function returned should be named with the endpoint name to 
ensure no conflicts with the primary load.
