The concept for this folder is to put models that control session data in file on a Mongo instance.  Usually run up specifically
for the project.  Must ensure that the Mongo folder is stored on an "external" drive to the docker container.  Else all data will 
be lost if the container is restarted.  

While this isn't set up yet on this project, one of the next steps is to give a basic setup via dockerfile and compose file.  Tie 
everything up in a neat, easy to duplicate, package.
